> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
It seems to have taken almost two weeks.
 I think I finished this work by studying and practicing skills alone by referring to various materials. 
 I should study harder because I know I lacked the ability to use kivy and Python.
Note: You may like to use the WakaTime plugin, which tracks exactly how long you spend in code. See http://wakatime.com (but note that the free version only has a 7-day history)

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
Above all, I tried to solve the problem independently without getting help.
Iam satisfied that I learned a lot about kivy and python through this.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
Too much work hurt my body and mind.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
Iam satisfied with the program because it seems to be organized neatly.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
I want to work on the project more skillfully by improving the utilization of kivy and Python.

## 6. Describe what resources you used and how you used them.
I used kivy and python, but I had a hard time because I'm not expert to use them.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
My program didn't work well and whenever there was an error, I got angry.
But I tried to put up with it and find a problem.
Eventually, we were able to overcome the problems and complete the project.
I have learnt how to respond to more projects in the future.
